# Fraud Credit Card Transaction Detector

The model implemented here is a simple Artificial Neural Network to identify fraudulent creditcard transactions given historical data of bank transactions. The dataset used for this project is the 'Credit Card Fraud' Detection from Kaggle. 
Artificial Neural Networks is a network of interconnected perceptrons that work based on pattern recognition. The trained model is capable of making predictions on future values. 
These models can be applied to a wide range of problems thanks to their non-linear data processing ability.
