# Fraud Credit Card Transaction Detector

The model implemented here is a simple Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network to identify fraudulent creditcard transactions given historical data of bank transactions. The dataset used for this project is the 'Credit Card Fraud' Detection from Kaggle. This model was built and trained using a hosted notebook on Google colab.

Artificial Neural Networks is a network of interconnected perceptrons that work based on pattern recognition. The model is trained using a Training dataset that contains an 'input' and a corresponding 'result' allowing it to form corresponding weighed assosiations that the model adjusts as it iterates through the Dataset. This is known as Supervised Learning. The trained model is capable of making predictions on unseen values. 
These models can be applied to a wide range of problems thanks to their non-linear data processing ability.
